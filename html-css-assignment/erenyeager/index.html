            Eren Yeager, also known as the Attack Titan, is the main protagonist
            of the Attack on Titan franchise. He is a young boy from Shiganshina
            District, the southernmost town of Wall Maria, the outer wall of
            Paradis Island, and the childhood friend of Mikasa Ackerman and
            Armin Arlert. He holds a personal vendetta against all Titans and
            his goal is to wipe them all off the face of the Earth, due to
            witnessing one of the Titans killing his mother.

                  Eren as a normal man-eating Titan was very small: 4 meters

                <li>
                  In a flashback, his father notes that as a child, Eren did not
                  make friends easily, and that's why he had only Armin.

                  Hajime Isayama stated in a interview that he based Eren's
                  titan form off of the Japanese martial artist Yūshin Okami,
                  paraphrasing it to be the "ideal physique of a middleweight
                  mixed martial artist."

                <li>
                  The opening song of the anime, Guren no Yumiya, seemingly
                  makes reference to this in its first lyrics ("Sie sind das
                  Essen und wir sind die Jäger!" lit. "They are the food and We
                  are the hunters!").

                <li>
                  The name Eren is of Turkish origin. It can be interpreted as a
                  "man", "saint", or "holy person". It's also phonetically
                  similar to "Aaron", which is the anglicised form of the Hebrew
                  name "Aharown" meaning "light bringer"
                </li>

                  Bryce Papenbrook the voice of English voice actor for Eren was
                  a fan of the series and was excited to voice Eren when he was
                  cast.
